1# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

The purpose of this analysis was to see how creditworthy are the borrowers of these loan services. We built a model using logistic regressions to complete this analysis.
We retrained the data to make the dataset more balanced and improve the performance of the model.

The results are as follows:
**Healthy Loan**
- Accuracy = 100%
- Precision = 100%
- Recall = 99%
**High-Risk Loan**
- Accuracy = 100%
- Precision = 87%
- Recall = 100%

Using the logistic regression model, the results show that it would be extremely precice and accurate for predicting a healthy loan, but not as perfectly precise for predicting a high-risk loan.
This means that 13% of the time, the company may be targeting the wrong borrowers as healthy borrowers, and the high risk ones would be syphoning more money from the loan business. 
This would put the business at a low risk, so I would summarize that this model would be good to use for analysis with it's borrowers. It would call for more features to help determine a healthy borrower.
